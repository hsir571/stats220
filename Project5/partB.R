# Minister: Rt Hon Christopher Luxon

# Features:  
# The text is very formal which makes sense as he is the prime minister and is addressing people in high standings. 
# The range of text varies as some are long and some are short depending on what he is addressig 
# A lot of the time the sentiment around what is being said is how it will benefit NeW Zealanders etc
